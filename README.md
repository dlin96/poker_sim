## Poker Simulation

# Motivation  
As someone who enjoys the occasional poker game (specificall Texas Hold'em), I have always enjoyed the strategy of the game. Most of this does come from playing with other human beings and includes difficult-to-quanitfy qualities like how much risk a person is willing to take or if an individual has a "tell" of some sorts indicating what kind of hand they may have. For this project, I decided to try and understand the mathematics behind the game.
